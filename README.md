# Yield-Farming (Decentralized Banking system)

A decentralized yield farming system, wherein banks can ask for the investors
to raise capital in their liquidity pool in return of incentives like percentage
return on investments on a monthly/yearly basis to the liquidity provider. The
liquidity provider can invest in the pool for the same, carry out transactions, stake the
tokens, expect returns and unstake when required. Both the parties can benefit, banks
by charging high gas fees from the users for staking or unstaking their investments and
liquidity providers by gaining returns from the investments made in the liquidity pool.
